;;(partition pred? lst) consumes a predicate (pred?) and a list (lst).
;;    It produces a two element list (list X Y) where X is a list of items
;;    in the consumes list that satisfy the predicate and Y is a list of
;;    those that don't satisfy the predicate.
;;partition: (X -> Bool) (listof X Y) -> (list X Y)
;;requires: The order of items in each list must be same as the original list
;;Examples:
(check-expect (partition odd? '(1 2 3 4 5)) '((1 3 5) (2 4)))
(check-expect (partition boolean? empty) '(() ()))
